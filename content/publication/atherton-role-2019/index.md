abstract: Many adolescents have difficulty regulating their impulses and become prone
  to externalizing problems (e.g., attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder [ADHD],
  oppositional defiant disorder [ODD], and conduct disorder [CD]) and other adverse
  consequences. Using multimethod data from a longitudinal study of Mexican-origin
  youth (N ϭ 674), assessed annually from age 10 to 16, we examined the relations
  between effortful control and ADHD, ODD, and CD symptoms over time. Bivariate latent
  growth curve models showed negative correlations between the trajectories of effortful
  control and ADHD, ODD, and CD, indicating that steeper decreases in effortful control
  were related to steeper increases in ADHD, ODD, and CD symptoms. Using a novel statistical
  technique, the factor of curves model (FOCUS), we found that ADHD, ODD, and CD share
  a common “externalizing” trajectory during adolescence. Although effortful control
  was strongly associated with this common trajectory, it had few unique associations
  with the individual disorder trajectories, above and beyond their shared trajectory.
  When we extended the FOCUS model to include the effortful control trajectory as
  an indicator, we found that ADHD and ODD had strong loadings, whereas effortful
  control and CD had comparatively weak loadings on the shared developmental trajectory.
  Follow-up analyses showed that a two-factor solution, with externalizing symptom
  trajectories on one factor and the effortful control facet trajectories on a separate
  factor, was a better fit to the data than a one-factor solution. Finally, parent
  ASPD symptoms were related to increases in CD, but had no significant influence
  on effortful control, ADHD, or ODD. We discuss the implications for personality
  and externalizing problem development.
