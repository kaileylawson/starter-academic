abstract: 'The present research examined: (a) the co-development of chores and effortful
  control, and (b) the prospective impact of effortful control development (i.e.,
  initial levels and the trajectory of effortful control from late childhood through
  adolescence) on work outcomes in young adulthood. We used data from a longitudinal
  study of 674 Mexican-origin youth assessed at ages 10, 12, 14, 16, and 19. We found
  no evidence of co-developmental associations between chores and effortful control,
  but we found that higher initial levels of effortful control (age 10) predicted
  working-student status, less job stress, and better job Ô¨Åt, and steeper increases
  in effortful control from age 10 to 16 predicted higher job satisfaction and job
  autonomy in young adulthood (age 19).'
