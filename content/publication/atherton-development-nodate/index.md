abstract: The present study investigated the developmental precursors of effortful
  control, a temperament trait that involves the propensity to regulate oneâ€™s impulses
  and behaviors, to motivate the self towards a goal when there are conflicting desires,
  and to focus and shift attention easily. Data came from the California Families
  Project, a multi-method longitudinal study of 674 Mexican-origin youth (and their
  parents), who were assessed at ages 10, 12, 14, 16, and 19. Effortful control (measured
  via self- and parent-reports) was moderately stable over time (r=.47 from age 10
  to 19), and its developmental trajectory followed a u-shaped pattern (decreasing
  from age 10 to 14, before increasing from age 14 to 19). Findings from latent growth
  curve models showed that youth who experience more hostility from their parents,
  associate more with deviant peers, attend more violent schools, live in more violent
  neighborhoods, and experience more ethnic discrimination tend to exhibit an exacerbated
  dip in effortful control. In contrast, youth with parents who closely monitor their
  behavior and whereabouts exhibited a shallower dip in effortful control. Analyses
  of the facets of effortful control revealed important disparities in their trajectories;
  specifically inhibitory control showed linear increases, attention control showed
  linear decreases, and activation control showed the same u-shaped trajectory as
  overall effortful control. Moreover, most of the precursors of effortful control
  replicated for inhibitory control and attention control, but not for activation
  control. We discuss the broader implications of the findings for adolescent personality
  development and self-regulation.
