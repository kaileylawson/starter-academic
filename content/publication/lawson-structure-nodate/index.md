abstract: The present study attempts to replicate and extend Snyder et al. (2015,
  JPSP). The original study examined the latent factor structure of the EATQ-R, a
  commonly used measure of adolescent temperament, and then showed that the resulting
  latent factors (i.e., Effortful Control, Negative Emotionality, and Positive Emotionality)
  had theoretically meaningful concurrent associations with various measures of adolescent
  functioning (depression, anxiety, ADHD, relational aggression, and school performance
  and behavior). We performed these same analyses using data from a large sample of
  Mexican-origin youth (N=674), and also examined prospective associations between
  the three EATQ-R factors and measures of adolescent functioning assessed two years
  later. We found some evidence supporting the bifactor model fit reported in the
  original study but poor replication of the correlations among latent factors. Additionally,
  model comparisons demonstrated that correlated factors models led to more interpretable
  factors than the bifactor models. In contrast, we replicated most, but not all,
  of the concurrent correlations (and extended the findings to prospective associations)
  between the EATQ-R factors and measures of adolescent functioning, supporting the
  construct validity of the EATQ-R as a measure of adolescent temperament. Thus, these
  findings raise concerns about the generalizability of the factor structure identified
  by Snyder et al. (2015), but bolster claims about the generalizability of the concurrent
  and predictive validity of the EATQ-R. Overall, meaningful differences between the
  present findings and those of Snyder et al. highlight the importance of ongoing
  construct validation in youth temperament research, especially with participants
  from groups traditionally underrepresented in psychological research.
