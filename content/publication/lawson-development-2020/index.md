abstract: Mexican-origin youth are at increased risk for school dropout and low educational
  attainment. High educational aspirations and expectations provide a potential source
  of resilience, given their association with positive educational outcomes. Using
  data from a longitudinal study of 674 Mexican-origin youth, we examined the development
  of educational aspirations (\"how far would you like to go in school?\") and expectations
  (\"how far do you actually expect to go?\") from 7th grade (Mage ¼ 12.8) to 2 years
  post–high school (Mage ¼ 19.8). Results indicate that Mexican-origin youth enter
  adolescence with very high aspirations and expectations (e.g., 67% expect to graduate
  from college) and maintain them even after transitioning into young adulthood. Several
  demographic and cultural factors, including parent education level, family income,
  the cultural value of familism, ethnic identity, and Spanish language use, were
  associated with higher aspirations and expectations.
