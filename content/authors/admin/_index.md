I am a doctoral candidate in Social-Personality Psychology at the University of California, Davis. 

I graduated from Pomona College in Claremont, CA in 2017 with Bachelorâ€™s degrees in Cognitive Science and Philosophy. 

My research examines personality development across the lifespan and associations with life outcomes. I have a particular interest in measurement and longitudinal methods.
